Welcome to my homepage.  I'm a scientist with an interest in nuclear
astrophysics and extreme-scale computing.  In short, **I use some of the world's
most powerful supercomputers to study some of the Universe's most powerful
explosions**.

I'm currently a Research Associate at Michigan State University.  I joined MSU
as a postdoctoral fellow in theoretical nuclear astrophysics in the Joint
Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics - Center for the Evolution of the Elements.
I work with Prof. Ed Brown and Prof. Hendrik Schatz to push at the frontiers of
our understanding of nuclear astrophysics through the study of X-Ray bursts and
the nuclear reactions that power them.  Please see [Research](/Research/) for
more.

Before coming to MSU, I was a research assistant and iACS Jr. Researcher Fellow
at Stony Brook University.  There I obtained my PhD, working in the astronomy
group under the advisement of Prof. Michael Zingale.  I came to Stony Brook by
way of a dual degree in physics and computer science from Hendrix College in
Conway, Arkansas.  I was born and raised in Arkansas, growing up in the town of
Benton.
