This is a collection of notes on various topics that I wrote for my own
reference that may be useful to the community as well.  Many are written using
the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), which I highly recommend.

- [Key reactions in helium shells on sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/amjacobs.net/assets/NBs/RxnNotes.ipynb).

- A [post-2007 bibliography [PDF]](/assets/scbib.pdf) of research into sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf explosions. [BibTeX file](/assets/scbib.bib). 

- [Accelerating Maestro's reaction calculations with OpenACC](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/amjacobs.net/assets/NBs/OpenACCNetOverview.ipynb)

- [Reactions in MESA](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/amjacobs.net/assets/NBs/RxnsInMesa.ipynb)

- [Building a website with Jekyll](website)

- [Installing CUDA Toolkit 8.0 and PGI 16.9 on Fedora 24](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/amjacobs.net/assets/NBs/OpenACCEnvironmentInstallNotes.ipynb)
