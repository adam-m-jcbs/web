    "# Installing CUDA Toolkit 8.0 and PGI 16.9 on Fedora 24\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a set of notes on my successful install of CUDA Toolkit 8.0 and PGI 16.9 for OpenACC development on a machine running Fedora 24.  Due to Fedora's model of having the latest software, the install is nontrivial and not likely to be successful based purely on following the PGI install instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OpenACC Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/openacc-toolkit), in theory, can install the CUDA and other needed components for PGI with one install script.  However, in addition to the special concerns Fedora 24 raises I prefer to install the CUDA Tookit separately since it allows Fedora's package manager to maintain it.  However, you should still sign up for the OpenACC Toolkit as it will give you a license for running PGI immediately as well as give you the opportunity to request a University developer license.  University researchers can get free licenses for PGI compilers (for one year, but renewable at no cost), making it easy to do local development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, I'm assuming all commands are run as root.  This\n",
    "process is not possible without root access.  I will assume you have a PGI license (e.g. via the OpenACC Toolkit).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install CUDA Components\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA's CUDA Toolkit website has good install guides.  I'll be following one.\n",
    "At time of writing, it was here: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads\n",
    "Entitled \"NVIDIA CUDA INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR LINUX\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) install headers and dev packages\n",
    "CUDA requires kernel headers and development packages that may not be installed\n",
    "by default.  For Fedora, these are installed via\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ dnf install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For my machine at time of writing, `uname -r` gives 4.7.2-201.fc24.x86_64\n",
    "\n",
    "These were already installed in my case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Install distro-specific toolkit\n",
    "\n",
    "Get CUDA Toolkit rpm from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you don't have any past installs of toolkit components.  For my machine, this\n",
    "meant verifying no conflicts in `dnf list | grep cuda`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file, this may cause problems with the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure RPMFusion free repository is enabled\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ dnf repolist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the .rpm file downloaded previously, install metadata and clean dnf:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ rpm --install cuda-repo-fedora23-8.0.44-1.x86_64.rpm\n",
    "$ dnf clean expire-cache\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The non-free repo can cause conflicts, so install cuda with it temporarily\n",
    "diabled:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ dnf --disablerepo=\"rpmfusion-nonfree*\" install cuda\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this installs X11 drivers, which I already had a version of from the\n",
    "nonfree repo.  It seems to have properly removed the nonfree version of the\n",
    "driver in favor of the cuda repo version, but watch for possible conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that PGI Workstation 16.9 defaults to assuming CUDA 7.0, while I just installed CUDA 8.0.\n",
    "So far I've not had problems, but if you need them archives of past versions 7.0 and 7.5 can be found here: \n",
    "https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-70\n",
    "https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-75-downloads-archive\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Get CUDA into your path, config system\n",
    "```\n",
    "export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/bin:${PATH}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the [Puget systems discussion](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/hpc/Install-NVIDIA-CUDA-on-Fedora-22-with-gcc-5-1-654/)\n",
    "you can configure your system by creating the file `/etc/profile.d/cuda.sh` containing\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The CUDA Toolkit install should've done this, but just for reference that discussion also recommends creating `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf` containing\n",
    "```\n",
    "/usr/local/cuda/lib64\n",
    "```\n",
    "then run\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ldconfig\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Install a gcc 5.3.1 module\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA is only compatible with gcc 5.3.1 (on Fedora).  While a guru in Fedora +\n",
    "CUDA + gcc + PGI could possible work out a fairly robust workaround allowing the\n",
    "use of F24's native gcc 6.1.x (for example, nvcc will often compile correctly\n",
    "with gcc 6.1.x as the host compiler if you pass the right collection of flags),\n",
    "the only solution that I can manage is to install gcc 5.3.1 and access it using\n",
    "environment modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get environment modules do\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ dnf install environment-modules\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you will be able to manage an install of gcc 5.3.1 in parallel with the\n",
    "system's default gcc (6.2.1 at time of writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, get gcc 5.3.1.  I don't think this is a GNU release version, but a Fedora\n",
    "one.  To be safe, I got it from fedora with \n",
    "```\n",
    "$ wget http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/gcc/gcc-5.3.1-20151207.tar.bz2/1458ebcc302cb4ac6bab5cbf8b3f3fcc/gcc-5.3.1-20151207.tar.bz2\n",

    "64-bit machine, and only install languages we want (otherwise it installs java\n",
    "and some other stuff, taking up time/memory).  You also need to configure the\n",
    "compiler so that gcc6 can compile gcc5 by setting the standard to gnu++98.\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ export CXX=\"g++ -std=gnu++98\"\n",
