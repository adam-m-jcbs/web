    "# Homework #7: Using the ODEINT Library to Model Systems with Coupled ODEs; The Butterfly Effect\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='brown'>__Sorry for all of the text here.__ </font>But, we want you to have a **very clear guide** right in front of you! Some of this will also be review from what we've already done in your in-class and pre-class assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are going to continue learning how to solve a wide class of models that are built out of ODEs. It turns out that this is extremely easy in Python because someone else wrote a library that is easy to use. All you need to do is wrap your brain around how the procedure is organized and then use that plan every time you use the library. Remember that `odeint` does not come from NumPy, although it very much uses it, but rather SciPy - look at the `import` command above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main things you need to know. **First**, the class of ODEs we will solve always have this form:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy_1}{dt} = f_1(y_1,y_2,...,y_N),$$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy_2}{dt} = f_2(y_1,y_2,...,y_N),$$\n",
    "$$\\ldots$$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dy_N}{dt} = f_N(y_1,y_2,...,y_N).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pause to think about this. There are $N$ equations, and that could be $N=1$ or $N=100$ - it doesn't matter. You can have as many as you need. Keep in mind that when you build a model for something your equations may not look like this yet. We saw an example earlier in the course in which we took a second-order ODE, not in this standard form, and converted it to two first-order ODEs, which is in this \"standard form\". (See the oscillator example below.) **Second**, note that if we always agree to write things in this form, the only thing we need to specify are the \"right-hand-sides\", which are $N$ functions $f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_N$. These functions are the derivatives by definition, because that is the way we organize our equations. You can see why we must always write things exactly in this format. **Third**, all ODE systems like this come with their initial conditions. Since we have $N$ equations, each will need its personal $y_n(0)$; we will need to also set that up. So, we have two things so far that we need to deal with up front: \n",
    "* Write the equations in this standard form to get the \"right hand side\" derivatives.\n",
    "* Write down the initial conditions for the set of equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "What else could there be? **Fourth**, we need to know how long to run. In the above example, the variable $t$ was used, so let's call it \"time\"; but, it's jsut a symbol and it could be anything. So, between what times do we want to solve these equations? Surely not forever, but for how long? That gives us our third item to set up:\n",
    "* Store the range over which we want to solve the equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is getting long - anything else? Yup. **Fifth**, the model you constructed very likely has some parameters that need to be set first. So, \n",
    "* Initialize any parameters your models needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **sixth**, call `odeint` to create the solution and, **seventh**, `plot` to reveal the results. Once things are set up, you are two lines of code away from seeing the solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's itemize these seven steps in something more like code:\n",
    "1. Write your equations in standard form.\n",
    "2. Write a Python function with the derivatives $f_n$ coded that receives the argument information $(y_1,y_2,...,y_N)$ and returns all of the $f_n$ as a list/array. \n",
    "3. Make a list/array that the initial conditions; for $N$ equations, this list/array will have $N$ items: `[y_1(0), y_2(0),...,y_N(0)]`. \n",
    "4. Make a list/array with the information of the interval you want a solution. You can do this with something like `time = np.linspace(0,10)`.\n",
    "5. Set any parameters your model needs.\n",
    "6. Call `odeint`, get the output it generates\n",
    "7. `plot` your results (or, use them in some way)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the important thing to remember: solving ODEs with `odeint` is really easy as long as you systematially break it down into these little steps. Great. Let's try it."

    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now it is **your turn** to do this from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='brown'>You will be coding one of the most famous modeling problems of all time.</font> As you would no doubt guess, modeling the weather is incredibly difficult. At some point in time it was not well known why this is. A person named [Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz) made a huge advance in terms our understanding; to make progress, he took the usual equations for modeling the weather and simplified them further to really get at the crux of the issue, an important lesson in modeling itself. His equations revealed to the world what is known technically as \"chaos\" or, perhaps more commonly, the \"butterfly effect\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations describing weather are what are called \"partial differential equations\" and they are truly complicated; we won't touch them in this course. What Lorenz did was simplify them to just three coupled ODEs, which is now within **your** reach to solve; just use the rules we laid out above. The equations have three parameters that feed into three ODEs that evolve things in time (in most respects, these three variables have lost their simple meanings in terms of weather, but you can think of them as quantities like temperature, humidity, flow). Here is what they look like in standard form. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\sigma (y - x), $$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = x (\\rho - z) - y, $$\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} = x y - \\beta z.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parameters $\\sigma$, $\\rho$ and $\\beta$ and three initial conditions $x(0), y(0), z(0)$ for these equations. Now, using everything you learned above, you can see that it is an easy task to code the Lorenz model. So, code the Lorenz equations! \n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment you will run the model several times. So, before you get started coding, keep that in mind. The big deal with what Lorenz did was to discover chaos. What exactly is chaos? It is often phrased as _sensitive dependence to initial conditions_. What exactly does that mean? Well, now that you are becoming an expert in ODEs, we can make a lot of sense out of this. What it means is that when you change the initial conditions _very_ slightly, you get a _very_ different answer; that is, the actual result is very sensitive to what you begin with at $t=0$. We can test this by running the model several times with slightly different initial conditions and plotting all results in the same plot. The result is quite striking, so let's get coding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Make these plots:\n",
    "* three plots as part of a subplot (1x3) that have $x(t)$, $y(t)$ and $z(t)$; after the plot, comment on your findings\n",
    "* make three phase space plots be plotting each variable versus the others, as in $x$ versus $y$, $x$ versus $z$, and so on...\n",
