    "# Day 10 In-class: Building Compartmental Models\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals for today's assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Think about how to build compartmental models for a variety of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's class you will be building three compartmental models. **There will be no coding today**, although you will code models like these later in the week. The goal today is learning to construct models. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure you are able to complete all three, be sure to budget your time accordingly. One idea is to take the amount of time you have left as of right now, divide by three and set a timer. (For example, you can type `timer 40 minutes` into Google and it will start a timer for you.) The instructor will also help to keep you on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might start with:\n",
    "* 15 minutes to brainstorm with your group, drawing a variety of variants of possible models. \n",
    "* 10 minutes to write the answers to the questions below. (You will likely improve your model as you write this.)\n",
    "* 5 minutes to transition to the next model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Read below to learn what you're expected to turn in for this assignment.**"

    "## What you need to turn in at the end of class.\n",
    "___\n",
    "* The names of the people in your group.\n",
    "* A picture of each of the three compartmental models. You can draw these on the whiteboards and take a picture.\n",
    "   - Think about which compartments you will need: what are the interacting things your model needs?\n",
    "   - Think about how these things interact, and draw a diagram like this to show those connections. \n",
    "![compmod](http://www.pmod.com/files/download/v31/doc/pkin/2389.png)\n",
    "   - Think about whether the connections are arrows or just lines, do the errors go in both directions? Think about what is causing the influence of one compartment on another and at what rate that might be happening.\n",
    "   - Be creative: use different colors, sizes, line types (e.g., dashed): the goal is to be able to express your model in a form that you can discuss it logically and be able to ultimately use it as a guide for coding it (perhaps using ODEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A written description of each of the models:\n",
    "    - What are the compartments you chose? Why did you choose those? Which did you consider that you felt were not needed? \n",
    "    - What are the dependencies between the compartments? Are there transitions between all of the compartments? Or, do some of the compartments only influence the other compartments? \n",
    "    - How many parameters does your model have? How would you go about getting these parameters?\n",
    "    - Once this model is complete and coded, how would you test it? What could you use the model for?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that this project is fairly opened ended. This is because _reality_ is open ended. You will be assessed on your ability to work as a team to come up with a logical and credible model, not to find the \"correct\" answer (which likely doesn't exist anyway).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important issues we face when building models is what needs to go into the model and what doesn't. Use whatever web resources you need to gather information and data; none of us are experts on the topics below, and a little research can help you build something credible."
