      "To get a feel for the basics of the nuclear reaction modules in `MESA`, I've examined the contents of `MESA`'s `net` module.  In particular, the contents of `net`'s test subdirectory `mesa/net/test`.  I try to balance going into detail and outlining the overall picture.  It's my hope that these notes can be used to give one an introduction to reactions in `MESA` such that they'll be capable of using `MESA`'s nuclear reaction modules in their own code.\n",

This information is associated with a \"handle,\" which is the index in an array of `General_Net_Info` types maintained in `$MESA_DIR/net/public/net_def.f`.  A given reaction network has an associated handle/`General_Net_Info` type.  When `read_net_file()` is called the file is used to initialize the handle's associated `General_Net_Info` type with the isotopes and reactions.  Up to this point we've only named the isotopes and reactions.  No physical data such as properties of the isotopes or reaction rates have been determined.\n",

      "`$MESA_DIR/data/rates_data/rate_tables/rate_list.txt` which lists the other files in that directory `r1.txt`, `r2.txt`, etc...  These are dummy examples of rate tables.  The basic structure is that rate_list.txt lists all the rate names and their corresponding files.  So the rates for reaction r1 is found in `r1.txt`.  Inside that file will be a list of ($T_8$, rate) pairs.  I can't find any non-dummy rate tables, maybe tables aren't often used in practice?  After that, `set_rate_ids()` sets a few rate IDs defined in `$MESA_DIR/rates/public/rates_def.f`.  Honestly, both of these steps seem to not accomplish much.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, `alloc_net_general_info()` is perhaps the most important part of establishing the network.  This builds the rate tables and associates them with the network's handle.  Where does it get the information to build the tables from?  Well, often the table data for a given reaction (e.g. the triple alpha reaction, which in `MESA` is called `r_he4_he4_he4_to_c12`) will already be cached in binary files found in `$MESA_DIR/data/rates_data/cache`.  \n",
      "\n",
      "However, we learn more by considering the case that the reaction rate table _isn't_ cached.  As can be seen in the call tree, this ultimately leads to a call to `set_raw_rate()` which consists of a **huge** select case statement listing almost all of the reactions `MESA` knows about (1117 in total at time of writing).  There's a more complete list in `$MESA_DIR/data/rates_data/reactions.list`, which contains 1246 rates at time of writing.  The reaction rate for each can be calculated using a number of sources: NACRE rates (C. Angulo et al., Nucl. Phys. A656 (1999)3-187), JINA reaclib rates (https://groups.nscl.msu.edu/jina/reaclib/db/), or Frank (X.) Timmes' tables/code (http://cococubed.asu.edu/code_pages/burn.shtml, which in turn are based on several sources cited on the website, notably Caughlin, G. R. & Fowler, W. A. 1988, Atom. Data and Nuc. Data Tables, 40, 283).  For all of these there exists a function with a suffix of \\_nacre, \\_jina OR \\_reaclib, or \\_fxt respectively.

The rate is evaluated by calling `rate_tripalf_nacre()`.  The NACRE paper/data provide both numerically computed tables of rates (which will be the most accurate rates) and analytic approximations of the rates.  This test, at least, doesn't access any tables for NACRE rates but instead relies on the analytic approximations.  I'm not sure if `MESA` has the NACRE tables somewhere or not (though it certainly has the ability to load in rates from such tables if you make them yourself).  \n",

A table of interpolants, `g%rattab_f1`, is also calculated since you'll usually have to interpolate to match the temperature of your fluid element from the discrete temperature steps available in `g%rattab`.\n",

So, for example, if you're looking at the code trying to figure out where in the heck the `g` variable came from in `do_test_net()`, you have to realize `g` is a `General_Net_Info` pointer shared by all subroutines in `test_net_support` and was initialized in phase 1 (`test_net_setup()`).  Confusingly, even though `Do_One_Net()` is a part of the `test_net_support` module and can thus see `g`, it has `g` passed to it.  Perhaps there are justifiable reasons for this confusing set of programming practices, but I wish shared data and function side-effects weren't relied upon so much and so inconsistently.
