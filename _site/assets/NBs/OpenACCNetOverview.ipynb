Rather, initially I prefer to focus on `vector` parallelism, which is parallelism over the CUDA cores in an SMX if you *don't* use `worker` parallelism and over the CUDA cores in a warp if you do.

For PGI, this `copyin` serves to 1) create, 2) allocate, and 3) attach each dynamic data member to the appropriate type on the GPU.\n",

    "GPUs are not CPUs.  A CPU core is very sophisticated and able to handle complex code flows.  GPU cores are plentiful, but dumb.  What this means is that although I would love to tell you the three-step narrative I laid out above is sufficient for getting your code running on GPUs, I can't.  Were you to execute this series of steps your code almost certainly wouldn't compile.  So either before (step 0) or, more realistically, after (step 4) you must modify your code so that any portion that needs to run on the GPU doesn't violate GPU restrictions.  Briefly, the primary restrictions I had to rewrite to avoid are:\n",
